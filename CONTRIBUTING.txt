# How to Contribute

It is sadly ironic that, for so many years, FatWatch was distributed as
proprietary software when the main audience for the software were readers
of The Hacker's Diet. Hackers, please accept my apology.

If you have made improvements to FatWatch and would like to see them made
available in the App Store, please use GitHub to open a Pull Request. I'll
do my best to review it promptly and, if appropriate, merge it into the
master branch.

# Copyright Assignment

Because the GPL is incompatible with the Apple App Store Terms of Service,
the only way to make FatWatch available on the App Store is by offering to
Apple under terms separate from the GPL. As copyright holder, Heroic Software
is able to do this.

However, this situation makes it necessary for all contributors to assign
copyright for their contributions to Heroic Software Inc.

This is a less-than-ideal situation, but one that makes FatWatch available
to as many people as possible while keeping it free. If you would rather not
assign copyright for your changes, the GPL protects your right to distribute
your modified version by other means.
