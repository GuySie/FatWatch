Launch:
- Compare WeightUnit in database vs defaults, offer to convert if mismatch.

Log View:
- Scrolling is a little jerky.
- Touch events get weird after return from modal view --- maybe fixed by presenting modal views on the parent controller?
- Need a tab bar icon.
- Use proper plus/minus signs in the trend delta.
- Descenders in note text are cropped sometimes.

Log Entry View:
- Pick a reasonable default weight if day before earliest day in database.
- "Save with no weight" does not update trend values properly.
- Don't recalculate trend numbers if weight didn't change.
- Display progress bar when updating trend values.

Graph View:
- Zooming?
- Redo design of drawing.
- draw trend line across months
- add a tickmark view on the side

Trend View:
- Need a tab bar icon.

General Problems:
- Too much data manipulation is handled in the event handling thread.  There should be an asynchronous data processing thread; UI elements should handle a "not ready" state and be notified when they can be redrawn.
- User needs quick way of getting to "Today" on log view and graph view.
- Need an Application icon: 57x57
- Need a Settings icon: 29x29

First Launch:
- Prompt user for earliest month (?)

Debug Settings:
- OnLaunchRecomputeTrendValues: recompute trend values on startup.
- OnLaunchVacuumDatabase

Idea: Jump To Button:
- User taps "Jump To", presented with a modal picker for all months and "Go" and "Cancel" buttons.  Can be used in the Log View and the Graph View.

Idea: Sync:
- Listen to a port and broadcast a service with Bonjour.
- Provide a desktop app that detects iPhone and syncs.
- Use a PIN confirmation like Bluetooth pairing.

Idea: Superimposed Diet Goal Line:
- Needs a new view to enter diet goal information
