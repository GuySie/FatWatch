Log View:
- Scrolling is a little jerky.
- Touch events get weird after return from modal view.

Log Entry View:
- The view should have separate View and Edit modes (like Phone contacts or Calendar events).  When you tap on an row with no weight measurement, you immediately go to Edit mode.
- Add a button to clear the measurement for that day.
- dismissing modal view while keyboard is up screws up view origin on iPhone

Graph View:
- Zooming?

Trend View:
- Add an EnergyUnit preference and use it to display cal/day versus kJ/day.
- Honor the ScaleUnit preference.  Perhaps this should be in the DB rather than the Preferences.
- TEST: Don't show Trends if we don't have enough data to compute them.  i.e., hide the "Last six months" group if we only have a month's worth of data.
- Don't allow row selection.

General Problems:
- There is no way to edit a row while leaving the weight value empty.  I often want to write a note for a day where I did not weigh myself.
- Too much data manipulation is handled in the event handling thread.  There should be an asynchronous data processing thread; UI elements should handle a "not ready" state and be notified when they can be redrawn.
- User needs quick way of getting to "Today" on log view and graph view.
- Need an Application icon.
- Need a Settings icon.
- Settings localization doesn't work.

First Launch:
- What do we do when there is no data?  Most views are useless until we have two weight measurements.
- Prompt user for ScaleUnit, store in database.

Debug Settings:
- OnLaunchRecomputeTrendValues: recompute trend values on startup.
- OnLaunchConvertLbsToKgs
- OnLaunchImportTestData

Idea: Jump To Button:
- User taps "Jump To", presented with a modal picker for all months and "Go" and "Cancel" buttons.  Can be used in the Log View and the Graph View.

Idea: Sync:
- Listen to a port and broadcast a service with Bonjour.
- Provide a desktop app that detects iPhone and syncs.
- Use a PIN confirmation like Bluetooth pairing.

Idea: Superimposed Diet Goal Line:
- Needs a new view to enter diet goal information
