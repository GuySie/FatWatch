	Weight: [pick] lbs/week [default -1]

Progress:
	Energy: cal/day (actual from start date to today)
	Weight: lbs/week (actual from start date to today)
	"X days to go"
	"X lbs to go"

	Clear Goal (button) [are you sure? prompt]


change Start Date, update Goal Date

Initially display only a "Set Goal" button, when pressed, display whole form with defaults.


Correctness:
- Update views after importing.
- after import, log and graph view "earliest" dates need to be reset

Performance:
- Switch to graph view is slow.

Cosmetic:
- Graph view: add scale along Y axis (weight)
- Graph view: not enough data warning is off-center

Enhancement:
- Display progress bar when updating trend values.
- Graph view: support zooming

Usability:
- If you quit the app on the weight entry view during Auto Weight In, save the data.

Debug Settings:
- OnLaunchRecomputeTrendValues: recompute trend values on startup.
- OnLaunchVacuumDatabase

Idea: Superimposed Diet Goal Line:
- Needs a new view to enter diet goal information
