To Do:
- entry view: clear button
- can tableview use key-value observing to update, rather than reloading data?
- automatically go to edit screen on launch if there is no data for today
- Trend view: support unit switching
- test "no data" startup
- don't allow selection on trend view
- fix: touch events get weird after return from modal view
- dismissing modal view while keyboard is up screws up view origin on iPhone
- user needs quick way of getting to "Today" on log view and graph view
- application icon
- settings icon

Ideas:
- log view: tap "jump to" button, presented with a picker for all months, 
	select a month and jump to it in the table view (could use same for graph)
- listen on a port and broadcast a service, make desktop app that can connect and sync data with PIN confirmation
- background thread to update trend values asynchronously

Definitely Later Features:
	Superimposed Diet Goal Line

Good news:
	recomputing trends on edit is not slow for 2 years of data
	
Design decision:
	lbs/kgs just affects the units assumed for the data, does not change values
	changing it will not convert
	- on start notice change and offer to convert data?
	- on first launch recommend going to Settings
