Launch:
- Compare WeightUnit in database vs defaults, offer to convert if mismatch.

Log View:
- Scrolling is a little jerky.
- Touch events get weird after return from modal view.
- Need a tab bar icon.

Log Entry View:
- The view should have separate View and Edit modes (like Phone contacts or Calendar events).  When you tap on an row with no weight measurement, you immediately go to Edit mode.
- Add a button to clear the measurement for that day.
- dismissing modal view while keyboard is up screws up view origin on iPhone

Graph View:
- Show placeholder view if less than 2 measurements.
- Zooming?
- Need a tab bar icon.

Trend View:
- Show placeholder view if less than 2 measurements.
- Need a tab bar icon.

General Problems:
- There is no way to edit a row while leaving the weight value empty.  I often want to write a note for a day where I did not weigh myself.
- Too much data manipulation is handled in the event handling thread.  There should be an asynchronous data processing thread; UI elements should handle a "not ready" state and be notified when they can be redrawn.
- User needs quick way of getting to "Today" on log view and graph view.
- Need an Application icon.
- Need a Settings icon.

First Launch:
- Prompt user for WeightUnit, store in database.
- Prompt user for earliest month (?)
- Show placeholders in Graph and Trend views until at least 2 data points.

Debug Settings:
- OnLaunchRecomputeTrendValues: recompute trend values on startup.
- OnLaunchVacuumDatabase

Idea: Jump To Button:
- User taps "Jump To", presented with a modal picker for all months and "Go" and "Cancel" buttons.  Can be used in the Log View and the Graph View.

Idea: Sync:
- Listen to a port and broadcast a service with Bonjour.
- Provide a desktop app that detects iPhone and syncs.
- Use a PIN confirmation like Bluetooth pairing.

Idea: Superimposed Diet Goal Line:
- Needs a new view to enter diet goal information
