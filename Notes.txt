Correctness:
- Update views after importing.
- after import, log and graph view "earliest" dates need to be reset

Performance:
- Switch to graph view is slow.

Cosmetic:
- Log view scrolling is a little jerky.
- Log view: descenders in note text are cropped sometimes.
- Graph view: extend trend line across months.
- Graph view: add scale along Y axis (weight)
- Graph view: not enough data warning is off-center

Enhancement:
- Display progress bar when updating trend values.
- Graph view: support zooming
- Show alert on device to confirm or cancel data upload.

Usability:
- User needs quick way of getting to "Today" on log view and graph view.
- If you quit the app on the weight entry view during Auto Weight In, save the data.

Debug Settings:
- OnLaunchRecomputeTrendValues: recompute trend values on startup.
- OnLaunchVacuumDatabase

Idea: Jump To Button:
- User taps "Jump To", presented with a modal picker for all months and "Go" and "Cancel" buttons.  Can be used in the Log View and the Graph View.

Idea: Superimposed Diet Goal Line:
- Needs a new view to enter diet goal information
