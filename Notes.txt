? Replace [Database weightCount] with an isEmpty method?

- Bug: Turn BMI off. Load Weigh-in screen. Picker cells only colored on refresh.

- Chart: introduce sampling to "All Time" view?

- Replace toolbar with slimmer selection control (e.g., App Store)

	server to device: OK
	server sends email with link or attachment
	
	user follows link, user can:
		download as CSV
		send to Hacker's Diet Online
		send to Weightbot
		send to PhysicsDiet
		download a chart?
		
	user taps Export button
	device prompts for email address (pre-filled with last entered, if any)
	device to server: START EXPORT FOR DEVICE UDID, EMAIL ADDRESS
	server to device: SEND NEW DATA
	-or-
	server to device: I ALREADY HAVE DATA FOR THAT PAIR (sends checksums)
	device to server: HERE IS NEW DATA
	server sends email with link / attachment

New Import Process

	user taps Import button
	device to server: IMPORT AVAILABLE FOR DEVICE ID?
	server to device: NO
	device prompts user for email address (pre-filled with last entered, if any)
