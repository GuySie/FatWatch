APPLICATION DESCRIPTION:

FatWatch is the most advanced weight tracker on the App Store.  Beyond recording your weight history, FatWatch computes a moving average, so you know which way your weight is trending regardless of day-to-day variations.

FatWatch also estimates your daily energy surplus or deficit (how much extra you are eating or burning each day), allowing you to intelligently adjust your diet and exercise plans.  FatWatch performs this estimation using your weight alone, without the hassle of searching a food database each time you eat something.

FatWatch is the only iPhone weight tracker that allows easy transfer of your weight history to and from your computer without additional software or online service accounts.

• Choose pounds, kilograms, or stones for weight; calories or kilojoules for energy.

• Scale increments of 1.0, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, or 0.05.

• Passcode Protection keeps your weight history private.

• Wi-Fi Import/Export: import weight history from other sources (such as Eat Watch for Palm), or export a comma separated text file for use anywhere.

• Use notes and checkmarks to annotate your weight history.

• Rotate FatWatch sideways to see a chart of your weight over time.

• Uses statistical methods consistent with The Hacker's Diet, but applicable to any diet or exercise plan.

• Scientific studies have demonstrated that people who weigh themselves daily are more successful at losing weight and maintaining their weight loss.


WHAT'S NEW IN THIS VERSION:

• Chart view: general improvements, including a Y-axis label, a goal line, and faster loading.

• Trends view: now includes a "Since Goal Start" section if a goal has been set and enough weight history is available.

• Settings: new scale increments of 0.05 and 0.2.

• Wi-Fi Import/Export: now accepts dates in both ISO format and localized short format.

• Various bug fixes.
