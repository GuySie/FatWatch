Application Description:


FatWatch is a diet-agnostic tool for your iPhone or iPod touch that can help you lose, maintain, or even gain weight. Enter your weight once a day, and FatWatch will compensate for daily fluctuations by computing a trend line, to let you see if your weight is truly trending up or down.

Using only your daily weight, FatWatch estimates your calorie surplus or deficit, allowing you to adjust your calorie intake as desired.

Features:

* Supported units: pounds, kilograms, and stones for weight and calories and kilojoules for energy.

* Supports scale increments of 1.0, 0.5, or 0.1.

* Wi-Fi Import/Export allows you to import existing weight history into FatWatch, or export for use in another program.

* Use notes and checkmarks to annotate your weight history.

* Rotate FatWatch sideways to see a chart view of your weight progress.


What's New In This Version:

Most importantly, the date-related issues have been fixed in this version.  This version also introduces Passcode Protection, a new tab for setting a Goal weight, and optional Weekend Highlighting (enabled in the iPhone Settings app).  This version also includes improvements to Wi-Fi Import/Export and Log scrolling performance.
