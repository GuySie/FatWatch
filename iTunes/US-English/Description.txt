FatWatch is a tool for people who are serious about managing their weight. Beyond simply recording your weight history, FatWatch compares your daily weight to a moving average, to let you see the real trends behind the day-to-day shifts in your body weight.

Using only your weight, FatWatch estimates and reports how many calories you are overeating or undereating, so you can intelligently adjust your diet and exercise plans. There is no need to fuss with an incomplete food database each time you eat something.

FatWatch also allows easy transfer of your weight history to and from your computer over Wi-Fi. Send a chart to your trainer or your doctor. No additional software is required.

• Passcode Protection keeps your weight history private.

• Rotate FatWatch sideways to see a chart of your weight over time.

• Use notes and checkmarks to annotate your weight history.

• Choose pounds, kilograms, or stones for weight; calories or kilojoules for energy.

• Scale increments of 1.0, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, or 0.05.

• Wi-Fi Import/Export: import weight history from other sources (such as Eat Watch for Palm), or export a comma separated text file for use anywhere.

• Uses statistical methods consistent with The Hacker's Diet, but applicable to any diet or exercise plan.

• Scientific studies have demonstrated that people who weigh themselves daily are more successful at losing weight and maintaining their weight loss.

NOTE: Several old customer reviews refer to a bug that prevented certain dates from being displayed correctly. That problem was resolved, but if I am wrong and you experience a similar problem, I offer a full refund.

WHAT'S NEW IN THIS VERSION:

• Chart view: general improvements, including a Y-axis label, a goal line, and faster loading.

• Trends view: now includes a "Since Goal Start" section if a goal has been set and enough weight history is available.

• Settings: new scale increments of 0.05 and 0.2.

• Wi-Fi Import/Export: now accepts dates in both ISO format and localized short format.

• Various bug fixes.
