Application Description:


FatWatch is more than just a body weight tracker.  Enter your weight every day, and FatWatch will use an exponentially smoothed moving average to compute a trend line, letting you know at a glance whether your weight is trending up or down, regardless of its day-to-day fluctuations.

FatWatch also estimates your daily calorie surplus or deficit (how much are you eating compared to how much you are burning), giving you useful information for adjusting your diet and exercise plans.  FatWatch computes this using your weight alone, without the hassle of searching a food database every time you eat something.

Features:

* Use pounds, kilograms, or stones for weight; calories or kilojoules for energy.

* Supports scale increments of 1.0, 0.5, or 0.1.

* Passcode Protection keeps your weight history private.

* Wi-Fi Import/Export allows you to import existing weight history into FatWatch, or export for use in another program.

* Use notes and checkmarks to annotate your weight history.

* Rotate FatWatch sideways to see a chart of your weight over time.


What's New In This Version:

This version also introduces Passcode Protection, a new tab for setting a Goal weight, and optional Weekend Highlighting (enabled in the iPhone Settings app).  This version also includes improvements to Wi-Fi Import/Export and Log scrolling performance.
