APPLICATION DESCRIPTION:

FatWatch is more than just a body weight tracker.  Weigh-in every day, and FatWatch will compute an exponentially smoothed moving average, letting you know instantly whether your weight is trending up or down, regardless of day-to-day fluctuations.

FatWatch also estimates your daily calorie surplus or deficit (how much are you eating compared to how much you are burning), giving you useful information for adjusting your diet and exercise plans.  FatWatch estimates using your weight alone, without the hassle of searching a food database every time you eat something.

• Use pounds, kilograms, or stones for weight; calories or kilojoules for energy.

• Supports scale increments of 1.0, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, or 0.05.

• Passcode Protection keeps your weight history private.

• Wi-Fi Import/Export lets you import existing weight history from other programs (such as Eat Watch for Palm), or export a comma separated text file for use anywhere.

• Use notes and checkmarks to annotate your weight history.

• Rotate FatWatch sideways to see a chart of your weight over time.  No online signup is required.

• Uses statistical methods consistent with The Hacker's Diet, but applicable to any diet or exercise plan.


WHAT'S NEW IN THIS VERSION:

• Chart view: general improvements, including a Y-axis label, a goal line, and faster loading.

• Trends view: now includes a "Since Goal Start" section if a goal has been set and enough weight history is available.

• Settings include new scale increments of 0.05 and 0.2.

• Wi-Fi Import/Export now accepts dates in both ISO format and localized short format.

• Fixed an issue where FatWatch would freeze when deleting the first weight entry if the second entry fell in a later month.

• Fixed an issue where the weight on the log entry view would not match the weight in the log.

• Fixed an issue where rows would flash when selecting the Goal view.
