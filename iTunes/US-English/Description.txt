Application Description:


FatWatch is more than just a body weight tracker.  Weigh yourself every day, and FatWatch will compute an exponentially smoothed moving average, letting you know instantly whether your weight is trending up or down, regardless of its day-to-day fluctuations.

FatWatch also estimates your daily calorie surplus or deficit (how much are you eating compared to how much you are burning), giving you useful information for adjusting your diet and exercise plans.  FatWatch estimates using your weight alone, without the hassle of searching a food database every time you eat something.

Features:

• Use pounds, kilograms, or stones for weight; calories or kilojoules for energy.

• Supports scale increments of 1.0, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, or 0.05.

• Passcode Protection keeps your weight history private.

• Wi-Fi Import/Export allows you to import existing weight history into FatWatch, or export a CSV file for use in another program.

• Use notes and checkmarks to annotate your weight history.

• Rotate FatWatch sideways to see a chart of your weight over time.


What's New In This Version:

• Chart improvements, including Y-axis labels, a goal line, and faster loading.
• Settings include new scale increments of 0.05 and 0.2.
• Wi-Fi Import/Export now accepts dates in both ISO format and localized short format.
• Fixed an issue where FatWatch would freeze when deleting the first weight entry if the second entry fell in a later month.
• Fixed an issue where the weight on the log entry view would not match the weight in the log.
• Fixed a visual glitch that would occur when selecting the Goal view.
